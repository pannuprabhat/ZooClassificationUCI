# ZooClassificationUCI

This a project in which we will perform Classification of Zoo animals based on their features.
This uses UCI data set of format .csv. 
The data set has been changed as follows :
  * The numeric data is changed with textual data.
  * There are no fixed number of features for any animal i.e an animal may contain 1 feature to a 1000 features, it will work.
  
In this project,four models of Machine learning are prepared namely:
  o	Support Vector machine 
  o	Logistic Regression
  o	Random Forest 
  o	K Nearest Neighbours Classifier
Deep Learning algorithm model, CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) is also used.
Each model outputs predictions and prediction probability for each class to .csv files.
The best model among the four models based on prediction accuracy is chosen to predict for the future

After the above functions,
•	There is a choice of attributes shown at command line
•	User can input the attribute of an animal he wishes to predict the catehory of and also the closest animal to the input attributes.
•	The project displays all the animals of the predicted category.
•	It also shows the best match to the animal in that category.


Conclusion:

The code may be used for various models that require features to be read from text and are labeled.
